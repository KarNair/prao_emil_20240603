Goal of a PRAO is to find out how it is like to work at a certain place.

This PRAO has two parts:

## Interviews

Here at NBIS and UPPMAX, we do many different things,
done by a diverse group of people with different opinions.
These people have signed up to have a chat with you,
so you can find out.

Some colleagues have planned an activity to do,
so will improvise and discuss their work.

If there is time, try to answer these questions per person.
